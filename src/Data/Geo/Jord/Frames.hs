-- | Local level, Wander azimuth frame.
--
--     * Position: The origin is directly beneath or above the vehicle (B), at Earth’s surface (surface
-- of ellipsoid model).
--
--     * Orientation: The z-axis is pointing down. Initially, the x-axis points towards north, and the
-- y-axis points towards east, but as the vehicle moves they are not rotating about the z-axis
-- (their angular velocity relative to the Earth has zero component along the z-axis).
-- (Note: Any initial horizontal direction of the x- and y-axes is valid for L, but if the
-- initial position is outside the poles, north and east are usually chosen for convenience.)
--
--     * Comments: The L-frame is equal to the N-frame except for the rotation about the z-axis,
-- which is always zero for this frame (relative to Earth). Hence, at a given time, the only
-- difference between the frames is an angle between the x-axis of L and the north direction;
-- this angle is called the wander azimuth angle. The L-frame is well suited for general
-- calculations, as it is non-singular.

-- | North-East-Down (local level) frame.
--
--     * Position: The origin is directly beneath or above the vehicle (B), at Earth’s surface (surface
-- of ellipsoid model).
--
--     * Orientation: The x-axis points towards north, the y-axis points towards east (both are
-- horizontal), and the z-axis is pointing down.
--
--     * Comments: When moving relative to the Earth, the frame rotates about its z-axis to allow the
-- x-axis to always point towards north. When getting close to the poles this rotation rate
-- will increase, being infinite at the poles. The poles are thus singularities and the direction of
-- the x- and y-axes are not defined here. Hence, this coordinate frame is not suitable for
-- general calculations.
