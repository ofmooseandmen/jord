### 2.0.0.0

- API change - all modules must be imported as qualified
- API change - Position has been split between Geodetic & Geocentric
- API change - Geodesic data type provides initialBearing, finalBearing, length and functions are removed
- New API - GreatCircle provides projection, isLeft, turn, discretiseCircle & discretiseArc
- Bug Fix - GreatCircle.intersection correctly handles minor arcs crossing the equator
- Bug Fix - All Geodetic positions built from a /n/-vector have the correct angle resolution
